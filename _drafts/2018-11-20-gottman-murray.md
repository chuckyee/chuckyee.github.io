Can you predict whether a married couple will divorce after observing them
engage in a single 15 minute conversation? This is the premise 


## What are we measuring?

How do you condense all the complexity of a human being engaged in a
conversation down to a single number? The researchers created the
*Gottman-Levenson* variable, which is based on SPAFF (Specific Affect Coding
System). SPAFF is a real-time coding system where an individual's affect,
mainly based on their facial expression, is coded along five positive, ten
negative, and one neutral code. Each code is assigned a value between $$-4$$
and $$+4$$ for each second. The codes are then summed over 6 second intervals
to generate the Gottman-Levenson variable, which ranges between $$-24$$ and
$$+24$$. The SPAFF codes are mutually exclusive.


Let $$H_t$$
