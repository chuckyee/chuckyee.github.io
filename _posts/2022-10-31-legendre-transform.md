For a physics student, the Legendre transform is one of those mathematical
techniques which textbooks often don't give as much love and attention as
compared to the Fourier or Laplace transforms. Yet, it's used in key pieces of
classical physics: you may have encountered it in thermodynamics, where it is
used to relate the internal energy of a system to other thermodynamic
potentials like the free energy or enthalpy. Or maybe you came across the
Legendre transform in classical mechanics as the link between the Lagrangian
and the Hamiltonian.

I found the Legendre transform to be opaque and less intuitive than other
operations:

* I did not understand why the Legendre transform $$G(p)$$ of a function
  $$F(x)$$ is defined by $$G = p\,x - F$$.

* Why is $$p$$ the derivative of $$F$$? How is it an independent variable?

* What is the intuition behind the Legendre transform anyway?

If you've asked the same questions, then my goal with this post is to share a
clear exposition of what the Legendre transform is, as well as why it is the
right way to describe the deep connection between energy, temperature and
entropy.


## Curves and tangent lines

I'll start by posing a seemingly unrelated problem, but it contains all the
intuition you'll need to understand Legendre transforms:

> If I give you a curve in the $$x$$-$$y$$ plane, how would you describe its
> tangent lines?

Here is a concrete example: say the curve is the parabola $$F(x) = x^2$$. Pick
a point on the parabola, say $$(1, 1)$$, and draw the tangent line:

![](/images/legendre/parabola-one-tangent.png)

One way to describe this particular tangent line is by its slope and
$$y$$-intercept, which are $$2$$ and $$-1$$ respectively. It's formula is

$$y = 2x - 1$$

Take another point on the parabola, say $$(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4})$$ and
again draw the tangent line. Its slope is $$1$$, and the $$y$$-intercept is
$$-\frac{1}{4}$$, so the formula for this second tangent line is

$$y = x - \frac{1}{4}$$

Imagine repeating this process for a bunch of points on the curve and
tabulating the slopes, which I'll call $$p$$, and for reasons I'll explain
further down, the *negative* of the $$y$$-intercepts $$G$$. The result is a
table like this:

| $$x$$ | $$F$$ | $$p$$ | $$G$$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|    -1 |     1 |    -2 |     1 |
|  -1/2 |   1/4 |    -1 |   1/4 |
|     0 |     0 |     0 |     0 |
|   1/2 |   1/4 |     1 |   1/4 |
|     1 |     1 |     2 |     1 |

Just as we have plotted $$F$$ against $$x$$, we can construct a new function
$$G(p)$$ by plotting the intercepts $$G$$ against the slopes $$p$$:

![](/images/legendre/duality.png)

This new curve of the intercepts vs. slopes is the Legendre transform. That's
it!

> The Legendre transform of a function is the negative $$y$$-intercepts of
> its tangent lines plotted against their slopes.

A neat property of the Legendre transform is that it contains all the
information of the original function, but encoded in terms of different
variables $$p$$ and $$G$$. In fact, the curve we constructed is an example of a
[dual curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_curve), which is an idea from
the field of projective geometry: plane curves can be described equally well as
a set of points or as a set of corresponding tangent lines.

Now you can answer the original question posed:

> If I give you a curve in the $$x$$-$$y$$ plane, how would you describe its
> tangent lines?
>
> Use the Legendre transform!

In the above example, the function $$G(p)$$ looks suspiciously like a parabola
as well. How would you compute the Legendre transform algebraically?

## From curves to equations

Let's rephrase the question in mathematical notation: given a function $$F(x)$$
with independent variable $$x$$, what is the procedure to compute the Legendre
transform $$G(p)$$, where the independent variable $$p$$ ranges over the slopes
of the tangent lines?

The trick is to consider the right triangle formed by the points on the
function $$F$$ and the negative $$y$$-intercept $$G$$:

![](/images/legendre/tangent-triangle.png)

Adding up the length of the two vertical line segments, the height of the
triangle is $$F+G$$. The width is $$x$$. The slope $$p$$ of the triangle is

$$p = \frac{F + G}{x}$$

which when rearranged gives a beautifully symmetric formula:

$$F + G = p x$$

You'll notice that if you swap $$F \leftrightarrow G$$ and $$x \leftrightarrow
p$$, the formula remains unchanged. This means that if you apply the Legendre
transform twice, you'll get back the original function: the transform is its
own inverse, an
[involution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)).

Now you see the reason we worked with negative $$y$$-intercept: if we had used
the regular $$y$$-intercept, the triangle height would have been $$F - G$$, and
the Legendre transform so defined would have an extra minus sign floating
around and not be an involution.

> Aside: not everyone defines the Legendre transform this way, so pay attention
> to minus sign conventions in the literature.

One other property to note is that if they were phyiscal quantities, the
Legendre transform $$G$$ must have the same units as $$F$$. For example, if
$$F$$ had units of energy, then $$G$$ must also be a measure of energy.
Likewise, the product $$p x$$ must also have units of energy. [How does this
relate to $$p$$ and $$x$$ being conjugate variables? What's the definition of a
conjugate variable and what physical process do they represent?]

Finally, solving for $$G$$, we get

$$G = p\, x - F$$

While this formula makes sense in terms of segment lengths of the triangle,
what is lost is the notion of what is the independent variable. Since the
Legendre transform is a function of the tangent line slopes, what we do is the
following: given the input $$F(x)$$

1. Find the tangent line slopes by taking the derivative $$p = f(x) \equiv F'(x)$$
2. Invert this equation to get $$x = f^{-1}(p)$$.
3. Insert into the expression $$p x - F(x)$$ to eliminate $$x$$ in favor of $$p$$

In summary, this is the prescription for finding the Legendre transform:

$$\boxed{
\begin{gather*}
  G(p) = p \, f^{-1}(p) - F(f^{-1}(p)) \\
  \text{where } f = F' \text{ and } f^{-1} \text{ is obtained by inverting } p = f(x)
\end{gather*}
}$$

Now we can answer the question of whether the Legendre transform of $$F(x) =
x^2$$ is also a parabola:

1. The derivative is $$p = f(x) = 2x$$
2. The original coordinate in terms of the derivative is $$x = f^{-1}(p) = p / 2$$
3. The Legendre transform is $$G(p) = p \cdot p/2 - (p/2)^2 = p^2 / 4$$

Yes, it's a parabola! Also, you can check that applying the transform again to
$$G(p) = p^2/4$$ will recover the original function, showing that the transform
is an involution.

> Aside on notation: I will use lowercase letters $$f = F'$$ and $$g = G'$$ to
> denote the derivatives of the original function $$F(x)$$ and its Legendre
> transform $$G(p)$$

Before we move on, I want to show one other way to compute the Legendre
transform that involves maximization, which turns out to be related to
something that is maximized in Nature (hint, it has to do with the second law
of thermodynamics).

Going back to the plot of our curve (solid green), pick a value of the slope
$$p$$ and draw the line $$y = px$$ passing through the origin (solid blue).
Then draw the tangent line with slope $$p$$ (dotted grey). The vertical
distance between the two lines is the $$y$$-intercept $$G$$. Here's the key
point: as we slide along the plot horizontally, the signed distance from the
curve $$F(x)$$ to the line $$y = px$$ reaches a maximum at the tangent point
(orange segment) and is exactly equal to the $$y$$-intercept $$G$$.

Put another way, if we plot $$px - F(x)$$ as a function of $$x$$, its maximum
value is $$G$$.

![](/images/legendre/legendre-supremum.png)

This gives us a second definition for the Legendre transform:

$$\boxed{G(p) = \max_x \{p\,x - F(x)\} \quad \text{for }F(x)\text{ convex up}}$$

Operationally, when calculating the maximum over $$x$$, we'll end up computing
the derivative of the argument $$p\,x - F(x)$$ and setting it to zero, which
gives $$p = f(x)$$ as before.

> For concave down functions, the definition is $$G(p) = \min_x \{p\,x - F(x)\}$$.

Now let's have some fun.

## Visual examples and curves which get us in trouble

I've worked out the Legendre transform in some common cases to give you a sense
of how it behaves. Taking a function and translating the curve upwards shifts
the Legendre transform downwards an equal amount:

![](/images/legendre/translate-up.png)

Translating the original curve to the right shifts the Legendre transform to
the left and downwards on a diagonal:

![](/images/legendre/translate-right.png)

You can find a whole slew of properties of the Legendre transform on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation#Further_properties).

Moving away from parabolas, the transform of the exponential function $$e^x$$
is only defined for $$p > 0$$ because the slopes of the tangent lines are all
positive.

![](/images/legendre/legendre-exponential.png)

The transform of the (natural) logarithm is again a logarithm:

![](/images/legendre/legendre-logarithm.png)

And for a fun one, the Legendre transform of a circle $$F(x) = \pm
\sqrt{1-x^2}$$ is the hyperbola $$G(p) = \mp \sqrt{1+p^2}$$:

![](/images/legendre/legendre-circle.png)

The top half of the circle corresponds to the bottom branch of the hyperbola,
and vice versa.

I've been careful to choose curves that have well-behaved transforms. What
kinds of curves have poorly-behaved Legendre transforms? Because the
independent variable $$p$$ in the transform is the slope of the tangent lines,
you might guess that a function $$F(x)$$ that is non-convex might behave poorly
because multiple points have tangent lines with the same slope. Here's an
example: a double well.

![](/images/legendre/legendre-double-well.png)

The Legendre transform (technically the
[Legendre-Fenchel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate) transform in
this more general case) becomes multi-valued. The two minima in $$F(x)$$ map
onto the "X" crossing on the vertical axes in the $$G(p)$$ plot while the two
cusps or "horns" in the transform correspond to the two points where $$F$$
changes concavity.

As an aside, transforms of non-convex functions are related to convex hulls and
the [Maxwell construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_construction),
but to avoid these complexities, we'll deal only with convex or concave
functions going forward. Another way of saying this is that we'll restrict
ourselves to functions whose derivative is *single-valued* when considered as a
function of $$p$$. For our purposes, that means $$p = f(x)$$ is monotonic
increasing or decreasing.

The example on the left is fine. The example on the right is not permissible
because there are some values of $$p$$ which corresponds to multiple values of
$$x$$.

![](/images/legendre/single-valued.png)

The fact that the derivative $$p = f(x)$$ is single-valued means that it has an
inverse $$x = g(p)$$. Choosing $$p$$ uniquely specifies $$x$$, and either one
could play the role as the independent variable.

> See the next section!

In the past three sections, we've explored the Legendre transform from the
perspective of duality for plane curves: the mapping between points and tangent
lines. In the following, I want to move from derivatives to integrals and
reinterpret the construction in terms of areas. This will give us a beautifully
symmetric view on the Legendre transform and lead to a connection to integrals
of inverse functions.

## From slopes to areas

Go back to the triangle in the plot of $$F(x)$$ constructed by picking a point
$$x$$ and drawing the tangent line, which led to the relationship

$$ p\,x = F + G $$

Each of the three terms is a length, and the equation essentially is two ways
to express the height of the triangle: "the height of the triangle is equal to
the slope $$p$$ times the width $$x$$, or equivalently, the sum of the line
segments $$F$$ and $$G$$".

Now switch to the plot of the derivative $$p = f(x)$$. What does the triangle
(specifically the height of the triangle) become?

![](/images/legendre/lengths-vs-areas.png)

In the $$p$$-$$x$$ axes, the three terms representing lengths become areas:

1. The height of the triangle $$p \, x$$ becomes a *rectangle* with dimensions
   $$x \times p$$.

2. The value $$F(x)$$ becomes the *area* under the curve $$f$$ integrated up to
   $$x$$:

   $$ F(x) = \int_0^x\! dx\, f(x) $$

3. To make things add up, the area above the curve $$f$$ must be the Legendre
   transform $$G$$!

This area diagram will give us the equation for the Legendre transform: to
express the area $$G$$ as a function of $$p$$, use the fact that the derivative
$$p = f(x)$$ is single-valued and view the curve in terms of its inverse $$x =
g(p)$$. I've flipped the axes and plotted the inverse below on the left:

![](/images/legendre/lengths-vs-areas-flipped.png)

The area under the curve up to $$p$$ is:

$$ G(p) = p\,g(p) - F(g(p)) $$

which is the Legendre transform. In terms of areas, the symmetry between $$F$$
and $$G$$ is beautifully explicit: they are the two partitions of a rectangle
defined by the derivative curve $$f(x)$$, or equivalently, $$g(p)$$.

The area diagram answers another question we hinted at earlier: how are the
derivatives of $$F$$ and $$G$$ related? They are inverses! Mathematically, the
area under the curve is the integral

$$ G(p) = \int_0^p\! dp\, g(p) $$

which means the derivative $$g(p) = G'(p)$$ is indeed the inverse of $$f(x) =
F'(x)$$, as promised.

Physicists will often abuse notation and write the duality between the
derivatives as

$$\boxed{
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dF}{dx} &= p \\
  \frac{dG}{dp} &= x
\end{align*}
}$$

Yes, it doesn't tell you when $$p$$ and $$x$$ are acting as functions or as
variables, but the equations sure are symmetric! Physicists like things that
look pretty even if they aren't mathematically rigorous.

## Differential form

The derivative equations points the way to differential forms physicists like
to write. Start from the definition $$G(p) = p\,x - F(x)$$, where $$x$$ is
understood to be the function $$x(p) = f^{-1}(p)$$. Take the differential of
both sides:

$$ dG = p\,dx + x\,dp - dF $$




Go back to the $$p$$-$$x$$ diagram and imagine making a small change to
the 

How do differentials behave? Imagine making a small change $$dx$$

Imagine making a small change in the height of the
triangle $$d(px)$$. Using the product rule gives $$d(px) = p\,dx + x\,dp$$

![](/images/legendre/differentials.png)

---

It turns out a useful quantity to examine is the derivative of $$g(p)$$. A
straightforward calculation gives the answer:

$$ \begin{align}
   \frac{dg}{dp} &= \frac{d}{dp} [ p\,x(p) - f(x(p)) ] \\
                 &= x(p) + p \, \frac{dx}{dp} - \frac{df}{dx} \frac{dx}{dp} \\
                 &= x(p)
   \end{align}$$

The derivative of the Legendre transform is the original independent variable
$$x$$.

Going back to differentials, what happens when we have a function $$f(x,y)$$ of
multiple variables and transform just one of them?

$$df = p\,dx + q\,dy$$

$$dg = x\,dp - q\,dy$$

The second term acquires a minus sign. The spectator variables aren't left
alone (why is this important?). Example:

$$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$$

$$g(p, y) = \frac{p^2}{4} - y^2$$

We went from a paraboloid to a hyperbolic paraboloid. Again, why is this
important?

$$df + dg = p\,dx + x\,dp$$

[Relationship with Laplace transform via saddle point]

xBehavior of differentials:

$$df = p \, dx \quad \text{where } p = \frac{df}{dx}$$

What about the differential of $$g$$?

$$dg = x\,dp + p \frac{dx}{dp} - \frac{df}{dx} \frac{dx}{dp}$$

The last two terms cancel, and we find

$$dg = x\,dp$$

Point is the slope of the Legendre transform is the original independent
variable $$x$$.



I can't pass up showing you one more surprising connection the Legendre
transform has to integral calculus before moving to physics.

## Integration of inverse functions

Back in 1905, the mathematician Charles-Ange Laisant published a short article
titled "Integration of Inverse Functions". In it, he posed a simple question:
given a function $$y = f(x)$$ which has an inverse $$x = \phi(y)$$, what is the
integral of $$\phi$$?

![](/images/legendre/laisant-1905-definitions.png){: width="500"}

Given the simplicity of the question, he wrote that he "could hardly believe
that this theorem is new." Laisant showed that

![](/images/legendre/laisant-1905-result.png){: width="500"}

which when translated to our notational convention ($$\phi \rightarrow g$$ and
$$\Phi \rightarrow G$$) is

$$ G(x) = x\, g(x) - F(g(x)) $$

Look familiar?! In fact, among the three proofs he provided, his graphical
proof is based on the area construction we discussed above. From this
viewpoint, the Legendre transform of a function is the integral of the inverse
of its derivative.

Another of the proofs provided by Laisant uses integration by parts:

$$
\begin{align*}
  \int\! f(x)\, dx &= x\, f(x) - \int\! x\, df(x) \\
                   &= x\, f(x) - \int\! g(p)\, dp
\end{align*}
$$

where we eliminated the differential $$df$$ by substituting $$p = f(x)$$ in the
second integral and used $$x = g(p)$$. Using the notation for the
antiderivatives:

$$
\begin{align*}
  F(x) &= x\, f(x) - G(p) \\
       &= x\, f(x) - G(f(x))
\end{align*}
$$

which is the same formula above if we swap $$f \leftrightarrow g$$ and
$$F \leftrightarrow G$$.

Here's an example of the formula in action. Given:

$$
\newcommand{\arctanh}{\mathop{\rm arctanh}\nolimits}
f(x) = \tanh x, \qquad g(x) = \arctanh x, \qquad F(x) = \log\cosh x
$$

straightforward substitution gives

$$ G(x) = x\, \arctanh x - \log\cosh\arctanh x
  = x\, \arctanh x + \frac{1}{2} \log (1-x^2) $$

where we used $$\cosh\arctanh x = 1 / \sqrt{1-x^2}$$.

![](/images/legendre/arctanh-integral.png)

The domain of the transform is restricted to $$[-1, 1]$$ because $$F$$ has
asymptotes with slope $$p = \pm 1$$.

To conclude these sections on mathematics, I hope you've discovered that the
Legendre transform is actually rather pedestrian and requires nothing more than
basic calculus to understand, yet provides insight into the tangents of plane
curves and the connections between core elements of calculus. It's properties
naturally find application in physics, which we turn to next.

## Potentials and their derivatives

In classical mechanics, we often want to know how a system will respond when we
apply some perturbation. For example, given a spring, what is the restoring
force when we stretch it an amount $$x - x_0$$ away from its equilibrium
length? The experimentally determined relationship in the linear regime is $$F
= -k\,(x-x_0)$$, termed Hooke's law.

However, another way to answer this question is to introduce the concept of a
potential energy $$V(x)$$ whose derivative with respect to $$x$$ tells us the
force:

$$ F(x) = -\frac{dV(x)}{dx} $$

For the case of a spring with spring constant $$k$$, the potential energy is
$$V(x) = k(x-x_0)^2/2$$.

> Note: the convention in physics is to compute the force of the potential
> acting on the object, so there's an extra minus sign floating around which
> we'll need to keep track of.

What if I wanted to construct a potential $$W(F)$$ whose derivative with
respect to the force $$F$$ experienced by the object gives us the displacement
$$x$$?

Use the derivative properties of the Legendre transform: the relationship
between the potential energy and force is just the first relation with the
substitutions $$f \rightarrow -V$$ and $$p \rightarrow F$$. Substituting $$g
\rightarrow -W$$ in the second relation gives:

$$ x(F) = -\frac{dW(F)}{dF} $$

The potential $$W$$ is the Legendre transform of $$V$$, up to some minus signs!
The answer for the mass attached to a spring is

$$ W = \frac{F^2}{2k} - Fx_0 $$

> What physical quantity does $$W$$ measure? It has units of energy, and it is
> the Legendre transform of the potential energy, so $$W$$ must be something
> related to the potential energy (and not, e.g. related to the kinetic
> energy).

The Legendre transform allows us to construct a potential where the perturbing
and reponse variables are swapped. In this example, the original perturbing
(also called the control or independent) variable $$x$$ is replaced in favor of
the response variable $$F$$. Control-response pairs occur in many physics, and
when they satisfy [XYZ] condition, they are termed conjugate variables.

## Lagrangians and Hamiltonians

For students of analytical mechanics, one of the first concepts introduced is
that of a Lagrangian, which is the kinetic $$T$$ minus the potential $$V$$
energy, written as a function of the coordinates $$q_i(t)$$ and velocities
$$\dot{q}_i(t)$$.

steps is to derive the
Lagrangian by imagining small displacements in the coordinates of a system. The
result is a functional that takes as input a function 

# Maximizing entropy

For students of thermodynamics, you may remember being introduced to a quantity
called the Helmholtz free energy, $$F = E - TS$$, and being told it is the
Legendre transform of the energy $$E$$. What does this quantity physically
measure and why is it related to energy by a Legendre transform?

What is entropy? Define entropy: it's the number of states compatible with
macroscopic constraints. Empirically, it's also a ratio of heat flow to
temperature. Consider bringing up entropy tables.

Assume the 2nd law of thermodynamics: that a system will evolve in such a way
to maximize it's entropy.

Given the classic set up of a system $$A$$ and a much bigger reservoir $$B$$,
what division of energy between the two parts maximizes entropy? Imagine we
start off with all the energy in $$B$$ and none in $$A$$. No energy in $$A$$
means its contribution to the entropy is zero, so

$$S_\text{tot} = S_B(E_\text{tot})$$

As we allow energy $$E$$ to flow from $$B$$ to $$A$$, the entropy of $$B$$ will
decrease while the entropy of $$A$$ increases.

$$S_\text{tot}(E, E_\text{tot}) = S_A(E) + S_B(E_\text{tot} - E)$$

How much does the entropy of $$B$$ decrease by? Taylor expand:

$$S_B(E_\text{tot} - E) \approx S_B(E_\text{tot}) - E \left. \frac{\partial S_B}{\partial E} \right|_{E = E_\text{tot}}$$

We call the slope of the reservoir's entropy $$\beta(E)$$, the inverse temperature.

$$\Delta S_\text{tot}(E) = S_A(E) - E \, \beta(E)$$

Where $$\Delta S_\text{tot}(E) = S_\text{tot}(E, E_\text{tot}) -
S_B(E_\text{tot})$$. The right hand side is the Legendre transform of the
entropy of $$A$$.

Because for a big system, its entropy is nearly linear in the energy, the
maximization of total entropy leads to the Legendre transform.

$$\Delta S_\text{tot}(\beta) = S_A(E(\beta)) - E(\beta) \, \beta$$

The Legendre transform of the entropy tells us how much the entropy will be
produced when bringing the system from absolute zero to $$T = 1 / \beta$$.

What does the Helmholtz free energy physically correspond to? The quantity
$$\beta F$$ is the total amount of entropy produced when bringing the system
from absolute zero to its final equilibrium temperature when placed in contact
with the resevoir.

Why is it's slope something we feel as hot and cold? Think about if we felt
total energy instead of temperature: we'd find the Earth unbearable.

Why are thermodynamic conventions different than the symmetric mathematical
presentation we chose above?

What is an example of this maximization in action? Example of gas piston with
spring. [Wait, doesn't this involve a change in volume?]
